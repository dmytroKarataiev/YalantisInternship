## UI Improvements
1. Back button isn't necessary in 1 Activity program.
2. Too much whitespace.
3. Main text should be visible better.
4. Inconsistent padding between elements.
5. Not required, but always nice to have some settings :)

## Additionally implemented - (build variant: full version)
* API calls to a "backend" and parsing of a JSON reply.
* Main activity with a list of tasks.
* Each task opens a Detail Activity.
* Used libraries: Retrofit, Butterknife, Picasso.
* Floating Action Buttons (share activity).
* Shared Transitions.
